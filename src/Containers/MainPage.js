                    We believe fitness should be fun and that social interaction is the key to achieving this. Whether it is a real-time pep talk from your significant other, an inspiring comment from your best friend or colleague, or likes from other friends in your social circle, the positive reinforcement will help you go that extra mile. Thatâ€™s why the app is designed to make it easy for you to connect with your friends, and we recommend that you invite at least a couple of your close friends to try it out.
